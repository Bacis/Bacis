# Web Portfolio

##### 2022/present - Senior Software Engineer - [Unbound](https://www.unboundnation.io/)
At Unbound, I lead the development of a web3 gaming asset rental system, integrating payment and rental functionality on Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon, and Immutable X. This cutting-edge platform revolutionizes how gamers interact with digital assets, allowing them to securely rent, trade, and monetize in-game items.

As a senior software engineer, I architect and implement the core functionality of the system. Leveraging my expertise in web3, I  focus on smart contracts on various EVM chains and seamlessly integrate them with our web application. This ensures a secure and transparent rental experience for gamers.

To enhance the platform's scalability and reduce transaction costs, I explore layer 2 solutions and integrate with protocols like Immutable X. This ensures smooth and cost-efficient transactions, optimizing the overall user experience.

Working at Unbound allows me to combine my passion for gaming, blockchain, and software engineering. I am excited to contribute to the evolution of the gaming industry by empowering gamers and unlocking new possibilities in the world of gaming asset ownership and utilization.
